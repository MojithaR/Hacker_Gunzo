## **🧩 What is Reverse Engineering?**
**Reverse Engineering** is the process of analyzing software to extract knowledge or design information from it. It's like peeling back the layers of an onion to reveal the core workings of an application. Whether it's understanding code to improve it or finding vulnerabilities, reverse engineering is a critical skill in the hacking world.

## **🛠️ Reverse Engineering Tools**
Here are some essential tools I use for reverse engineering:

- **🔍 Ghidra**: A powerful open-source software reverse engineering (SRE) suite.
- **🔨 IDA Pro**: Industry standard disassembler for analyzing binary programs.
- **🐍 Python**: For scripting and automating tasks.
- **🛡️ Radare2**: A set of utilities to examine, analyze, and manipulate binaries.
- **💡 GDB**: The GNU Debugger, useful for testing and debugging applications.
