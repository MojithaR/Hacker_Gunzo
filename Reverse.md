# **🔍 CTF Challenge Walkthrough: Reversing 'Rev_Reverse ret'**

In this challenge, we’re working with a binary file called `Rev_Reverse ret` and need to reverse engineer it to find the password and retrieve the flag.

---

## **📋 Challenge Summary**

1. Reverse engineer the file `Rev_Reverse ret` to find the correct password.
2. Use the password to unlock the file and retrieve the flag.

---

## **🛠 Tools Needed**

1. **`cat` Command**  
   - The `cat` command will allow us to view the raw contents of the file to search for any visible clues.
2. **Hex Editor** (Optional)
   - A hex editor can help if deeper inspection of the binary file is needed.
3. **Disassembler/Debugger** (Optional)
   - Tools like `Ghidra` or `GDB` are useful for analyzing the program’s logic if necessary.

## **🚶 Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

1. **Inspect File Permissions**
   - Ensure `Rev_Reverse ret` has executable permissions so we can run it:
     ```bash
     chmod +x 'Rev_Reverse ret'
     ```

2. **Run the File**
   - Start by running the file and see if any prompts or messages appear:
     ```bash
     ./Rev_Reverse\ ret
     ```

   - When prompted, enter random guesses to observe how the program responds.

3. **Use the `cat` Command**
   - Use `cat` to display readable content in the file, sometimes revealing useful text strings:
     ```bash
     cat 'Rev_Reverse ret'
     ```

   - Scrolling through the output, we see clues like:
     ```
     "Enter the password to unlock this file: %s"
     "Password correct, please see flag: picoCTF{...}"
     ```

   - The flag and message are embedded here, and this confirms that we found the correct answer. 🎉

## **🏆 Final Flag**

After some exploration, we retrieved the flag: `picoCTF{3lf_r3v3r5ing_succe55ful_1de05085}`
