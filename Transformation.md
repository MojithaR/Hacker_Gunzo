## **🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Download the Encoded File:**  
   Start by downloading the encoded file using the `wget` command:
   ```bash
   wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/1d8a5a2779c4dc24999f0358d7a1a786/enc
   ```

2. **Give Necessary Permissions:**  
   Before attempting to open the file, ensure it has the required permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod +x enc
   ```

3. **Attempt to Open the File:**  
   Upon opening the file, you might notice it contains characters that resemble Chinese letters. This indicates that the file is encoded or encrypted using a different character set.

4. **Decode the Text Using CyberChef:**  
   To decode the text, head over to [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) and follow these steps:
   - Paste the encoded text in the input space.
   - Select the operation as `Magic`.
   - Enable `Intensive Mode`.
   - Use `Extensive Language Support`.
   - Set the flag format to `picoCTF`.

5. **Bake and Retrieve the Flag:**  
   After baking the input with the above settings, you'll retrieve the flag:
   ```text
   picoCTF{16_bits_inst34d_of_8_e703b486}
   ```
