# **📱 APK Flag Hunt - CTF Challenge Walkthrough**

Welcome to the **APK Flag Hunt** challenge! In this Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge, our goal is to analyze an APK file, locate and retrieve a hidden flag. The flag is cleverly embedded in a common but overlooked location, waiting for us to discover it. Ready to crack the APK? Let’s dive in! 🚀

---

## **📜 Challenge Overview**

This challenge provides us with an APK file named `timer.apk`, and our task is to uncover the hidden flag. The flag isn’t just in plain sight—it’s embedded in an unsuspecting part of the APK’s metadata. Let’s use a decompiling tool to extract the code and find the flag!

### **Challenge Steps**:
1. Download the `timer.apk` file and use `jadx` to decompile the APK.
2. Analyze the `AndroidManifest.xml` and other critical files for hidden clues.
3. Extract the flag from the `android:versionName` field in the `AndroidManifest.xml`.

## **🔧 Tools Needed**

1. **jadx**  
   - `jadx` is an open-source tool for decompiling APK files. It allows us to convert the APK’s Dalvik bytecode into readable Java code and extract resources such as `AndroidManifest.xml`.
   - **Installation**: Download `jadx` from [GitHub](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) and follow the instructions to install it on your system.

2. **Text Editor (Optional)**  
   - You’ll need a text editor like VSCode or Notepad++ to open and inspect the extracted files.

## **👣 Step-by-Step Guide**

### 1. **Decompile the APK with `jadx`**  
   First, use `jadx` to decompile the `timer.apk` file. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
   
   ```bash
   jadx -d output_folder timer.apk
   ```
   - This command will decompile the APK and extract the contents into an output folder.

### 2. **Analyze the `AndroidManifest.xml`**  
   Navigate to the `output_folder` created by `jadx` and open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. This file is crucial as it contains metadata about the app, such as versioning, permissions, and components.

   Inside the `AndroidManifest.xml`, look for the `android:versionName` attribute, as the flag is hidden there. It may appear as a seemingly normal version number, but with a closer inspection, you'll find that it’s a flag formatted like `picoCTF{hidden_flag_here}`.

   Example:

   ```xml
   <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
             package="com.example.timer"
             android:versionCode="1"
             android:versionName="picoCTF{hidden_flag_here}">
   ```

### 3. **Retrieve the Flag**  
   In this case, the flag is embedded in the `android:versionName` field of the `AndroidManifest.xml`. Copy the value inside the `versionName` field:

   ```
   picoCTF{hidden_flag_here}
   ```

   This is your hidden flag! 🎉

## **🚩 Finding the Flag**

Once you've extracted the flag from the `AndroidManifest.xml`, you should see the following:

   **Flag**: `picoCTF{hidden_flag_here}`
